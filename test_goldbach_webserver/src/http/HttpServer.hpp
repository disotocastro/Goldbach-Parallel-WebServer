/**
@brief Implements a minimalist web server.

A web server is a software that listens for client connections,
accept them, waits for requests of resources, and answers the requests. All
communication with clients are following the rules of the HTTP (HyperText
Transfer Protocol).

A HttpServer is a stand-alone object, you do not require to inherit a class.
A web server should be a generic software that may be used for many
applications. A web application is a piece of software that deals with a
specific domain, e.g: a marble shop, a video game, a newspaper, and so on.
Your HttpServer can be connected with an arbitrary number of web
applications. The following code shows how the server can answer requests
of two different applications, one for lottery results and other for pets.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  // Create the web server
  HttpServer httpServer;
  // Create some web applications
  LotteryWebApp lotteryWebApp;
  PetsWebApp petsWebApp;
  // Register the web application(s) with the web server
  httpServer.chainWebApp(&lotteryWebApp);
  httpServer.chainWebApp(&petsWebApp);
  // Start the web server
  return httpServer.run(argc, argv);
}
```

In the previous code, when a request arrives, the server asks the lottery
application to examine the request. The lottery application will study the
HttpRequest fields (e.g: URI) to determine if the request is about lottery.
In such case, the web application returns true to the server indicating it
managed the request. If the application returns false, indicates the server
that the request was not intended for the lottery application, and the server
repeats the process with the following application in the chain: the pets
application. If no application manages the request, a 404 Not-found response
is sent to the client.
